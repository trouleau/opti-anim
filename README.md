## Motivation

This package provides an interface to experiment with the design of Gradient descent algorithms:
* Gradient descent
* Stochastic gradient descent
* Line search
* Conjugate gradient descent
* Momentum
* Nesterov accelerated gradient

These algorithms can be vizualized as 2d animations.

## Dependencies

This project relies on Numpy & Scipy for computations and on Matplotlib for visualization.

Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the dependencies.

## Demos

To run the tutorial demos, run ```python anim.py --demo N``` where N can go from 1 to 10.
